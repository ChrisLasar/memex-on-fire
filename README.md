## Our Vision
Thought Tank a Zettelkasten for the web.

The system not only supports the storage and management of your thoughts and ideas. It also helps you to connect these thoughts and let new thoughts and insights arise from them. It also encourages you to continuously improve.

**We make your own mind the smartest discussion partner for your thoughts.**

## Our Values

In contrast to other solutions, you decide who stores and processes your thoughts. You can change this at any time. Thereby the entire history of your thoughts is preserved. And should you one day no longer want to use ThoughtTank, your notes are still available as plain text files (markdown).

**Your thoughts are yours.**
